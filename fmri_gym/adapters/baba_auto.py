"""Baba Is Auto adapter -- Baba Is You's levels on the baba-is-auto C++ engine, via ``baba-auto-gym``.

utilForever/baba-is-auto simulates the real game's ruleset -- pushes, word
tiles parsed into rules each turn, SINK / HOT-MELT / DEFEAT / OPEN-SHUT,
transformations, MOVE -- on the original levels' text maps, where ``baba``
(nacloos/baba-is-ai, the other Baba backend) generates small synthetic
puzzles. ``baba_auto_gym`` (``gym/baba_auto/``) is the Gymnasium env over
its ``pyBaba`` module, drawing with the engine's own GUI sprites (24 px tiles;
the display scales the frame up). The engine is built from, and the maps and
sprites read from, the baba-is-auto checkout at ``external/baba_auto`` (README
"External checkouts"), or the phase's ``repo``.

A phase's ``keys`` index ``Discrete(5)``: 0 = wait, 1 = up, 2 = down,
3 = left, 4 = right. The phase's ``game`` is a map name under the checkout's
``Resources/Maps`` (``baba_is_you``, ``out_of_reach``, ``off_limits``, ...) or
a map file's path. Logged per turn: ``play_state`` (0 PLAYING, 1 WON, 2 LOST)
and the ``(16, H, W)`` state tensor. No savestate -> seed + action replay.
