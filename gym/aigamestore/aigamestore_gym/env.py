"""AI GameStore games as a Gymnasium environment.

AI GameStore (https://aigamestore.org) is a benchmark of ten LLM-generated
browser games -- plain HTML + JavaScript, nine on p5.js and one on three.js --
built to compare vision-language models with human players. The paper's own
harness drives the page in real time with Playwright: it pauses the game while
the model thinks, then holds keys for 0.2 s segments on the wall clock. That
has no ``step()`` and no seed, so it cannot be trained against or replayed.

This env keeps the browser (the games are the browser) but takes over its
clock. ``lockstep.js`` runs in the page before the game and replaces
``requestAnimationFrame``, ``setTimeout``, ``performance.now``, ``Date`` and
``Math.random``; one :meth:`step` then dispatches key events, advances the game
by exactly ``frame_skip`` of its 60 Hz frames and returns the canvas pixels and
the game's own ``getGameState()``. Time does not pass between steps, so a model
that deliberates for a minute and a human at the keyboard meet the same game,
and ``reset(seed=...)`` plus the action sequence replays an episode exactly.

Observation: the game canvas as an RGB ``Box`` (each game has its own size,
e.g. 600x400). Action: ``MultiBinary(len(keys))`` -- which of the game's keys are
held this step; see :data:`GAME_KEYS`. Reward: the change in the game's
``score``. ``info["state"]`` is the game's full state, exactly as
``getGameState()`` returns it (``gamePhase``, ``score``, ``currentLevel``, and
every other field the game exposes, however nested).

An episode is one level: ``reset`` starts ``level`` afresh (score 0, full
lives) through the game's ``window.loadLevel(n)`` hook, and the episode is over
as soon as the game leaves PLAYING (a win, a loss or a level-complete screen)
or its level counter moves -- the games differ in which of these they do when a
level is cleared, and this rule covers all of them. The game is then stepped
``end_steps`` more times with no key held, so the win / lose / level-complete
screen stays up long enough to be read (2 s at the default rate) instead of
flashing for one frame; ``terminated`` is reported on the last of them. A game
without levels (game4, an endless runner) has episodes that end when it is lost.

Not supported: sound (the games have none) and savestates (replay from seed).
Needs a Chromium-based browser (the system Chrome by default; pass
``browser_channel=None`` for Playwright's bundled Chromium after
``playwright install chromium``). The games load p5 / three.js from a CDN, so
the first run needs network access.
