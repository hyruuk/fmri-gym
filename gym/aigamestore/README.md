# AI GameStore — Game Environments

Source code for the 10 game environments featured on the AI GameStore platform, plus `aigamestore_gym`, a Gymnasium env that plays them in lock step.

Each directory (`game1` … `game10`) is a self-contained, browser-based game implemented in plain HTML and JavaScript (no build step). Open a game's `index.html` to run it.

```
game1/ … game10/
  index.html      # entry point
  *.js            # game logic (ES modules)
aigamestore_gym/
  env.py          # AIGameStoreEnv: MultiBinary keys in, canvas + getGameState() out
  lockstep.js     # init script: the page's clock and Math.random, under the env's control
```

Rendering is done on an HTML canvas in code; no external art assets are required. The games have no sound.

## The gym env

```bash
pip install -e .            # from this directory; needs a Chromium browser (system Chrome by default)
```

```python
import gymnasium as gym, aigamestore_gym
env = gym.make("AIGameStore/game6-level3-v0")   # or aigamestore_gym.AIGameStoreEnv("game6", level=3)
obs, info = env.reset(seed=1)
obs, reward, terminated, truncated, info = env.step([1, 0, 0, 0, 0])   # hold env.keys[0] == "LEFT"
```

One `step()` holds the keys the action marks and advances the game by exactly `frame_skip` of its 60 Hz frames -- no time passes between steps, so the game is the same however long the agent takes to decide, and `reset(seed=...)` plus the action sequence replays an episode. The observation is the canvas (RGB), the reward is the change in the game's `score`, and `info["state"]` is the scalar part of `getGameState()` (`gamePhase`, `score`, `currentLevel`, ...).

An episode is one level: `reset()` starts the env's `level` afresh through the game's `window.loadLevel(n)`, and the episode is over as soon as the game leaves PLAYING (a win, a loss, a level-complete screen) or its level counter moves. The end screen then stays up for `end_steps` more steps (20, i.e. 2 s at the default rate) with no key passed on, and `terminated` comes on the last of them. `GAME_LEVELS` says how many levels each game has -- game4 has none (an endless runner, the episode ends when it is lost), game6 is one long level, game7's are procedural without an upper bound. See the docstring of `env.py`.

## Changes to the games

The games differ from the ones on the platform in three ways, all so they can be played without a keyboard in front of them: level clears and game overs advance by themselves after 3 s (no "press ENTER" / "press R" prompts); the on-canvas control hints take their key names from `?label_<KEY>=` query parameters, so a host that remaps keys (a button box, say) can show the key the player really presses; and each game's `window.loadLevel(n)` (a dev-mode hook on the platform) starts level `n` as a fresh game -- score 0, full lives, PLAYING.
